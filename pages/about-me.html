    <center><p>I am a high school student interested in math, drama, and computer science. </p>
        Although this is my first time taking a computer science/any tech course, </p>
        I am hoping to learn as much as possible from my peers and teachers. </p>
        My other interests include painting, knitting, and cooking. </p></center>
